# **Collaborative Writing on Airpen**

Collaborative writing is a powerful tool for groups such as organizations, communities, and non-profits. This feature also aids bloggers who may want to work with co-authors to diversify their content. Collaborative writing allows multiple writers to contribute to a single draft before it is published.

You can add up to three co-authors to your articles or even change the main author. The latter gives full editing rights to another person if you so desire.

## **Adding Co-Authors**

To collaborate with others on a piece, you need to add them as co-authors. Here are the steps to do that:

**Step 1**: Click on the **Add A Co-Author** button. This will bring up a pop-up search window.

**Step 2**: In the pop-up, search for co-authors using their **wallet public address** or their **username**.

Click on a user's name to add them as a co-author. Clicking the name again will remove them.

**Tip**: All your co-authors can find the draft article on their **[Write](https://www.airpen.cc/write)** page on Airpen.

## **Changing the Main Author**

To pass on the main authorship to someone else, follow these steps:

**Step 1**: Click on the **Change Author** button located at the bottom of your draft.

**Step 2**: Search for a new main author using their **wallet public address** or their **username**.

Selecting a new author will relinquish your editing access to the draft. Only the new author will be able to make changes.
