## **Adding Articles to a Feed**

The feeds on Airpen work like a series or topic-specific playlist of articles for readers. Including an article in your feed collates related publications in one place, improving organization and discoverability.

When you add an article to your feed, your subscribers are notified, potentially increasing engagement and fostering a loyal reader base.

### **Creating a Feed**

Creating feeds can be initiated from two places:

1. **In your draft**: Click “Publish”, and if no feeds are available in your profile, you will be prompted to create one.

Airpen helps you grow and manage your reader community efficiently.

Once your article has been tagged and added to a feed (optional), clicking "Publish" will alert your subscribers via email, encouraging them to engage with your new content.

# **Tips to Increase Engagement**

Engaging directly with subscribers can build community and loyalty around your content. Responding to comments and questions, ensuring high-quality content, and maintaining relevance to your target audience can significantly increase readership over time.

You may also consider distributing your articles on other platforms to reach a broader audience. Copy the link to your article and share it on social media or other platforms to gain more readers.
