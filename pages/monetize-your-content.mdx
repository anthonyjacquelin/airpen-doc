Creators can generate revenues from their content on Airpen. We are building a monetization system that allows creators to earn incomes from their content. We are planning to support 2 major incomes sources:

- **Earn revenues while writing on Airpen**
- **Earn passive incomes by leveraging your audience**

## Earn revenues while writing on Airpen

Start by publishing your content on Airpen. From there, you will be asked to set the revenues settings for this publication.

Note that of course, you can also publish content for free, and not earn any revenues from it. The purpose is to give you the opportunity to earn incomes from your content if you want to.
But before generating revenues if you don't already have any audience to leverage, you might want to first adopt a monetization strategy...

Revenues settings are defined by the author. The auhor can set the following settings:

- **Content price**: the amount to pay to get access to the content
- **Referrer share**: the percentage of the revenues that will be shared with the referrer

Without a referrer, the author will earn the full content price.

## Earn passive incomes by leveraging your audience

**Definition of a referrer:**<br></br>
A referrer is a person who share a link to a publication from Airpen with his audience. A referral link should contain the referrer public address (wallet address) in the URL. This is how we can track the referrer and give him a share of the revenues generated by his referral link.

With a referrer, the author will earn the content price minus the referrer share,
and the referrer will earn the referrer share.

The **Referrer earns**: $Referral Percentage * Content Price$

For example, if the content price is {"$10"} and the referrer share is 10%, the referrer will earn {"$1"} and the author will earn {"$9"}.

**Tips:**<br></br>
The more the referrer share is high, the more the referrer will earn, but the less the author will earn. The author should find the right balance between the referrer share and the content price.
Also, the referrer share should be high enough to incentivize people to share the content, but not too high to not make the author earn too little.
It is up to the author to find the right balance between the referrer share and the content price.
