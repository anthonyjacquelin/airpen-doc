# How to grow your subscribers base ?

There are many ways to grow your subscribers base, in this page we are going to show you the most effective ones.

## Add a subscription form to your publications

We created a custom Subscribe Form plugin that you can add to your publications to collect emails from your readers.

<div
  style={{
    margin: "20px",
  }}
>
  <FormPlugin onSuccess={() => alert("hello)")} />
</div>

To add this plugin to your publication, just hit `Tab` or click on the `+` button and select **Subscribe Form**.

Once someone subscribes to your Form, the reader receive an email to confirm his subscription which needs to be confirmed in order to be added to your subscribers list on your profile page.

You can track your subscribers growth on your profile page, in the **Subscribers** section.
